This is a first-pass at a basic R tutorial.

The Condor-specific bits and the R code work fine, I just need to clean up the 
wrapper script.

It should
	1) Check to see if R is installed on the system
	2) If not, pull down a copy of R and compile it for the target machine

The R source has been removed from this collection of scripts since it is 
readily available elsewhere.
